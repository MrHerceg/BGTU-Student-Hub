The mobile application solves this problem by providing students with centralized and structured access to all the necessary information about their curriculum. It allows students to easily monitor their schedules, manage their academic responsibilities, communicate with teachers and receive important notifications from deans, ensuring effective and successful academic passage. Thus, the application helps to optimize the learning process and increases students' satisfaction with their learning experience.
